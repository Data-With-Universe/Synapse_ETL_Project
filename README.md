# Synapse_ETL_Project

# Project Title

## Overview
This project showcases the powerful capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics through a seamless ETL pipeline. By transforming HTTP requests into data stored in Azure Storage Accounts, we leverage the serverless SQL pool and Spark pool for querying, and visualize the transformed data through insightful visuals.

## Key Features
- **HTTP Data Ingestion**: Efficiently transformed HTTP request data into Azure Storage, ensuring a robust and scalable data ingestion pipeline.
- **Serverless SQL Pool**: Utilized Azure Synapse's serverless SQL pool for real-time data querying, enabling flexible and cost-effective data exploration.
- **Spark Pool Integration**: Leveraged Spark pools for advanced data processing and transformations, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Data Visualization**: Created intuitive and interactive visuals to present the transformed data, turning raw data into actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
  - Serverless SQL Pool
  - Spark Pool
- **Azure Storage Account**
- **Power BI** (or any other tool you used for visualization)
